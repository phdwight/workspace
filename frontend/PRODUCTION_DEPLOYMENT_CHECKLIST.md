# Production Deployment Checklist ✅

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Build Configuration
- [x] Vite config uses correct base path (`/workspace/`) for GitHub Pages
- [x] PWA manifest icons use correct base path
- [x] Service worker properly configured
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] CSS variables and styling properly included in production build

### ✅ Component Functionality
- [x] Balance Summary page with all three views (Summary, Details, Settlements)
- [x] Expense form functionality
- [x] Event creation functionality
- [x] Local storage service working
- [x] PWA features (service worker, manifest)
- [x] Mobile-responsive design

### ✅ Assets and Resources
- [x] All static assets (icons, SVGs) properly referenced
- [x] CSS files correctly bundled and compressed
- [x] JavaScript files correctly bundled and compressed
- [x] PWA manifest properly configured

## Deployment Commands

### For GitHub Pages Deployment:
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Manual Deployment Steps:
1. **Build Production Files:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify Build Output:**
   - Check `dist/` folder contains all necessary files
   - Verify `index.html` has correct asset paths with `/workspace/` prefix
   - Confirm PWA files (manifest, service worker) are generated

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Test on Deployed Site:
- [ ] Main page loads correctly
- [ ] All CSS styling appears as expected
- [ ] Balance Summary page displays all three views
- [ ] Expense form functionality works
- [ ] Event creation works
- [ ] PWA installation prompt appears (mobile)
- [ ] Offline functionality works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### Performance Checks:
- [ ] Fast loading times
- [ ] Proper caching headers
- [ ] Service worker functioning
- [ ] Gzip compression working

## Troubleshooting

### If CSS doesn't load:
1. Check browser DevTools Network tab for 404 errors
2. Verify asset paths in `index.html` match actual file locations
3. Clear browser cache and CDN cache if applicable

### If PWA features don't work:
1. Verify manifest.webmanifest is accessible
2. Check service worker registration in DevTools
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)

### If routing doesn't work:
1. Verify base path configuration matches deployment environment
2. Check server configuration for SPA routing

## Ready for Production ✅

The application is now configured and ready for production deployment with:
- ✅ Correct GitHub Pages base path configuration
- ✅ Properly configured PWA features
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Enhanced Balance Summary functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Production-optimized builds
